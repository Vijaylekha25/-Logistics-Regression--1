    "\n",
    "1.Linear Regression: Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the given independent variables. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the dependent variable is categorical with two levels (e.g., 0 or 1). It models the probability that a given observation belongs to a particular class. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not based on features like the presence of certain keywords, sender's address, and email length. Logistic regression uses the logistic function (or sigmoid function) to map the output to the range [0, 1]."
